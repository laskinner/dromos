# Dromos

## Purpose

Dromos is designed to enhance user engagement and collaboration within a specific interest community through dynamic interactive node graphs which users can create, edit, maintain. This platform targets both public and private sector researchers, scientists and stakeholders, offering tools that not only facilitate comprehensive visualization of causal pathways, but also encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing.

This Readme explicates the following with the regard to the Dromos front-end. For back-end related topics, such as back-end technologies and database structure, see [Dromos-be](https://github.com/laskinner/dromos-be).

## Technologies Used

The technology stack and design choices for Dromos were purposefully selected with a clear focus on its future public use and the necessity for continuous evolution. The adoption of TypeScript over JavaScript, ShadCN/UI instead of Bootstrap, and TailwindCSS rather than traditional vanilla CSS, were all strategic decisions made to ensure the platformâ€™s suitability for external parties. These choices are essential for maintaining the integrity and extensibility of Dromos as it transitions from initial development and portfolio project into a public-facing offering. The technologies chosen are not only robust and scalable but also support the objective of ongoing iteration and refinement, which is crucial considering that Dromos is intended to be enhanced and expanded by different developers over time.

### [React](https://reactjs.org/)
Used for building user interfaces with components, allowing for efficient and flexible UI development.

### [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
Used for enhancing JavaScript code with static type definitions, TypeScript offers improved maintainability, understandability, and robustness of the codebase. By introducing static typing, it helps catch errors early in the development process and provides a more scalable foundation for large projects.

### [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
Used for creating custom designs quickly with a utility-first CSS framework, enabling rapid styling directly in markup.

### [ShadCN/UI](https://github.com/shadcn/ui)
Used for creating modern and interactive user interfaces with a set of high-quality, customizable React components.

### [Lucide-React](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide)
Used for integrating scalable vector icons as React components, enhancing UI designs with easily customizable icons.

### [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
Used for incorporating a wide array of icons into web and mobile interfaces, customizable via CSS for various design needs.

### [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
Used for schema declaration and validation, ensuring data integrity with type-safe input validation in JavaScript and TypeScript applications.

### [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
Used for managing state in React applications, providing a simple and minimalistic approach to global state management outside of the React render cycle.

### [SigmaJS](http://sigmajs.org/)
Used for drawing and managing large network graphs efficiently, enabling interactive visualizations directly within web applications.

### [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
Used for efficient and fast package management, pnpm offers a unique node_modules structure that saves disk space and reduces installation time by avoiding redundancy.

### [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
Used for front-end tooling, Vite provides a fast development environment by leveraging modern web technologies. It offers hot module replacement and optimized build times, significantly improving the developer experience.

### Validator Testing

**Note: Due to  errors and attempts at critical bug fixing until project submission, code has not yet been passed through a validator**

- **HTML**: Passed W3C validation without errors.
- **CSS**: No errors on Jigsaw validator.

### Known Bugs

- Editing and deleting graphs, nodes, and comments is not functioning due to conditional rendering not having the reuquired data to render the functionality.

## Deployment

Deployed on Heroku:

Automated deployment on Heroku is set up. To deploy, simply merge to main.

If errors arise, logs can be found in Heroku instances:

Front-end: dromos
Back-end: dromos-backend

## UX

### Nodes on design
In general, the choice keep Dromos simple is that it is a SaaS app for business purposes, and in a highly technical space. Therefore, bright colors, unneeded imagery and any otherwise distracted media and colors were not used. As well, the choice to maintain a highly minimal design was done purposefully to maintain flexibility, as there will be changes in the future.

### Graph View
This was the original Balsamiq for the Graph View. One can see the difference between the mock-up and final implementation, as it became apparent that a dropdown would rather than scrollable cards would free up space for other needed functionality, such as the selected graph card and create node button.

### Navbar
Here, the actual implementation closely resembled the mock-ups of the Navbar:

### Needed improments

Some improvements would be required, including:
- Node Quick drawer, which appears upon clicking a node
- Comment formatting and node full view

Additional improments would include:
- Additionaly rendering algorithms for graph
- Arrows on graph rendering to show directionality
